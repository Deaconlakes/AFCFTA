            <h3 class="special">Required certifications/documents</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Becoming a certified exporter in Nigeria can open up a world of opportunities for businesses and individuals looking to expand their operations and reach new markets. However, to benefit from exporting to African countries, exporters in Nigeria must follow a set of procedures and fulfill certain requirements. These procedures include complying with the local laws and regulations that govern the export process in Nigeria, and the laws and regulations that govern the imports into the country of destination. In this guide, we will explore the key requirements to become a certified exporter in Nigeria, provide an overview of the certification process, and point out the direct links to access further information.
            To make all these steps more convenient, they are available and can be partially or totally completed online, seamlessly. Relevant links to this effect will be added.</p>

            <br>
            <h3>CAC Registration</h3>
            <p>
                Before any trader can export from Nigeria, they must first register their company in Nigeria. This is a mandatory requirement, as every business operating in Nigeria must be fully incorporated and registered. The registration process is crucial for both business and export transactions, as it establishes the credibility and legitimacy of the entity. The Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) oversees the business registration process in Nigeria. Traders are advised to retain the service of a lawyer or an accredited Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) representative to assist in processing the registration.
                <br>
                The steps for obtaining a CAC certificate are outlined below:
                <br>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Complete the registration form (CAC 1) via the registration portal on the CAC website. This form is used to reserve the company name and check the availability of names. https://www.cac.gov.ng/

                </li>
                <li>
                    Confirm the availability of the name requested. If the name is not available, you will need to conduct another search. However, note that there is a small fee attached to this.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Obtain the necessary statutory forms (CAC 2, CAC 2.1, CAC 3, CAC 7, etc), fill out the paperwork, attach the required documents, and submit.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Pay the required fees.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You will be notified when your certificate of incorporation is ready. You will be informed when to collect it after the Corporate Affairs Commission has processed your application.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Detailed step-by-step instructions and further information on how to go about CAC Certificate of Incorporation registration can be found here.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <br>

            <h3>Nigerian Export Promotion Council (NEPC) Registration</h3>
            <br><br>
            <p>
                The next mandatory certification is the registration with NEPC to become a registered exporter in Nigeria. This can only be done using the e-registration platform available on the NEPC website.
                <br>
                <br>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Obtain required documents such as the Certificate of Incorporation (obtained from CAC), MoA, and Form CO7. You can view the required documents based on your business entity here.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Create an account on the e-registration platform. Follow the prompts, fill out the forms required, upload relevant documents, and make the necessary payment.
                </li>
                <li>
                    NEPC will then verify and validate your submitted documents. If all criteria are satisfied, NEPC will issue you your Certificate of Registration (an e-copy will be sent via email while a physical copy can be picked up from the nearest NEPC outstation), else compliance directives will be issued if criteria are not met.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Detailed step-by-step instructions and further information on how to go about NEPC registration can be found here.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>Product Standard Certification</h3>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>
                This is the process of verifying that a product conforms to specified standards and requirements set by a regulatory body or a specific industry. It involves testing, inspecting, and evaluating a product to ensure that it is safe, reliable, and meets the necessary requirements for the intended market. Certification can be applied to not only products but also management systems and personnel.
                In Nigeria, product certification involves the issue of a mark from the Standards Organization of Nigeria (SON) to demonstrate that a specific product meets a defined set of requirements in the Nigeria Industrial Standard. SON is the only body empowered to issue the mandatory product certification mark in Nigeria, and this is done through the Mandatory Conformity Assessment Programme (MANCAP) for products produced in Nigeria.
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>Importance of the Product Standard Certification</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    It helps your product stand out in the eyes of the consumer, and increases the consumer’s confidence in the product and the manufacturer.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It helps to ensure that products are safe for consumers to use and meet required quality standards.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It guards against liability and reduces the risk of legal action.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It helps products reach a wider market, as certification may be required for entry into specific markets.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                As mentioned earlier, SON issues the mandatory certification mark in Nigeria, however, this is divided into two programmes which are the MANCAP (Mandatory Conformity Assessment Programme) and the SONCAP (SON Conformity Assessment Programme). While the MANCAP is for products manufactured in Nigeria, the SONCAP is for products manufactured outside Nigeria, with the aim of regulating all imports into Nigeria. MANCAP
                The MANCAP Scheme is a requirement for manufacturers to meet external standards for their products to be sold to Nigerian consumers. The scheme aims to ensure that locally-made products meet quality standards and are safe for consumers.
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>MANCAP Certfication Steps (Local-Manufacturer)</h3>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>To be issued the MANCAP certification mark, a product must go through the following process:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Visit the Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON) office nearest to you. You can locate a nearest SON office here.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Obtain the MANCAP application form and a copy of the standard, which states the quality requirements for the product.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Prepare for the inspection by ensuring that the production site is ready for inspection starting from raw materials inspection to in-process, to end-product, to quality control, packaging, and storage.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Wait for inspectors to visit the production site and conduct an inspection. During this process, they will check for compliance with the standard and ensure that the product meets the qualification criteria.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Random samples of the product will be drawn for analysis.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The product will undergo testing using the standard as the test criteria.
                </li>
                <li>
                    After testing, the test report will be evaluated to see if it indicates that the product meets the qualification criteria.
                </li>
                <li>
                    There will be a second review of the product application to ensure the Evaluation is accurate before a decision can be taken.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If the product satisfies the requirements of the standard, it will be awarded the MANCAP certification mark, which is valid for three years at the first instance.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The certified product and factory will be placed on routine surveillance inspection to ensure the product still meets qualification criteria.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A NIS logo with a unique identification number will be issued upon the completion of a quarterly inspection. If relevant NIS standards are not met, a compliance directive will be issued.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>Product Type Certification (Exporter)</h3>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>
                If you intend to export your product from Nigeria, you have to find out the standard requirement of the destination country for his/her product and compare it with the Nigerian Standards. If the standards of the destination country are the same as Nigerian Standards, you can present the MANCAP certification to the destination country tp prove that your products have been certified. However, if there are gaps between the destination country’s standards and Nigerian standards, SON will carry out the necessary certification to cover these gaps, and issue a Product Type certification for export.
                To learn more about this, visit the SON Product Certification page. SONCAP
                The Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON) enforces technical regulations for all imported products using the SONCAP scheme, which stands for the Standards Organisation of Nigeria Conformity Assessment Program. This scheme verifies that products meet NIS and other technical standards before they are shipped to Nigeria.
                If you're planning to import products into Nigeria, you should start by going to the Single Window for Trade Portal. There, you can simulate the import process by entering HS codes, and the system will show you which agencies are involved and their requirements.
                All imported products must be tested and certified overseas, and the standards for each product can vary. Independent Accreditation Firms (IAFs) that are approved by the Nigerian government carry out testing and inspection of these products offshore and issue Product Certificates (PCs). SONCAP has three major routes for assessing conformity, depending on the risk, safety, and potential health effects of the product.
                These routes include Conformity Verification for unregistered/unlicensed products, Registration and Conformity Inspection for registered products, and Product Certification Systems for licensed products. Each route has three major steps, including the issuance of Product Certificate, followed by a test report and Certificate of Conformity (CoC) issued by the IAF after a successful test report and satisfactory verification.
                When your imported goods are about to enter Nigeria, you'll be issued a SONCAP certificate. To learn more about the SONCAP certification and the IAF, visit the SONCAP page.
                Conformity Assessment Procedures (CAPs)
                Conformity Assessment Procedures (CAP) are a set of procedures that verify whether a product, service or system meets the required technical standards and regulations of the importing country or region. To gain entry into local, regional, and global markets, a product must adhere to the technical regulations set by government bodies and demonstrate compliance by undergoing Conformity Assessment Procedures (CAPs).

                    The World Trade Organization's Agreement on Pre-shipment Inspection (PSI) mandates the use of agreed-upon standards between the buyer and seller, or in the absence of such standards, for verifying product quality and quantity. Nigerian exports require Product Type Certification, and both imports and exports undergo Pre-shipment Inspection using approved standards. Further information regarding these standards can be accessed on the SON website.

                Export products face challenges that go beyond standard specifications, rather it involves conforming to the technical regulations of each destination country. In the past, a lack of information about these regulations posed a significant barrier to trade, but with easy access to the internet, Nigerian businesses can obtain correct information about the technical requirements and related conformity assessment procedures needed to ensure compliance with the country they want to export to. Additionally, Nigerian businesses should obtain information on the technical requirements of importing countries from the National Enquiry Points (NEPs) set up by each WTO member country.
